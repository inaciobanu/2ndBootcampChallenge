# Unit 2 Bootcamp Challenge: Portfolio

## My Task

Welcome to my second Bootcamp Challenge! This week, we had to build a portfolio page that we would be able to update as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work showcases each developer's skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights someone's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Research shows that students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (aka they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 
 
With these points in mind, in this challenge i have tried to set myself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I got to practice my new skills while creating something that hopefully i will use during my job search. It’s a win-win that i'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** Since I'm a complete newbie and don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, i used placeholder images and names. I do plan to change them to real applications as i create them later in the course.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
* When presented with my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the reader's viewport.

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Outcomes

I was required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application is [Here](https://inaciobanu.github.io/2ndBootcampChallenge/)

* The URL of the GitHub repository that contains my code is [Here] (https://github.com/inaciobanu/2ndBootcampChallenge).
